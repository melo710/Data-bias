681,0121f89898790454, 26 November 2005 UTC  Well Permyakia and Perm Oblast have established economic ties and a lot of common infrastructure鈥攖hats one of the main reasons  Also Permyakia is heavily dotational relying on the federal transfers to form a significant portion of its budget  Problem is federal government is not always good with transferring funds timely which as you imagine creates all sorts of issues  Perm Oblast on the other hand is a donor and once both budgets are merged it will ease the pain somewhat but note that during 2006 there will still be two separate budgets so there will be a transitional period  Another thing鈥擯ermyakia will still have a special status within new Perm Krai  The main scoop is that Permyakia will no longer need to rely on federal governments transfers but will of course become dependent of Perm Krais budget and Perm Oblast will gain access to Permyakias resources  The merger also lowers administrative costs鈥攊nstead of two local governments there will only be one  Considering that Russians and KomiPermyaks coexisted peacefully for quite some time there is something in this merger for both parties  In 2003 a poll of 309 people was conducted among the population of both oblast and autonomous district  The most common promerger responses were because together is better 21 because the common budget will create better opportunities for the territories development 19 because the government will be able to build new bridges and roads 15 and because there will be a reduction in the number of government workers 12鈥?1543,no

1031,01b61a5a8cab9bbf,Listen S is the new rest system of the rockets after the acceleration is finished Why is this so hard to understand So if you perform a Lorentz transformation of points A and B from system S where the ships are moving with v after acceleration to S where they are at rest after acceleration you are calculating the endpoints of resting objects in S thus you have the rest length of the objects and the distance between the endpoints And what do the LorentzTrafos tell us Well they unambiguously show that the distance between A and B again those are the coordinates of the endpoints of in S resting objects has increased as compared to the coordinate length between A and B in S Of course this is in perfect agreement with relativity of simultaneity which shows that the spaceships started at different times in S thus they had different accelerations  Summarizing 1 You have two endpoints A and B with different accelerations in S therefore they are moving away from each other in S and after the acceleration the distance of the now resting objects has increased and the string has been stretched 2 Of course one can also choose frame S in which the accelerations appeared to be the same due to relativity of simultaneity and therefore the increased distance in S apparently stays the same in S Actually one should abandon the word appear in relativity it serves no purpose and only distracts one from correctly applying the Lorentztransformation   Now Dewan Beran and Bell unfortunately started with 2 and only afterwards at 1 so they had to focus their attention mostly on S and on length contraction which caused much confusion by some readers But the paradox is much easier to understand if one like Petkov and Franklin starts with 1 and then look at 2  BTW As explained above modern authors understand the paradox very well and some of them even try to confirm it experimentally Bells spaceship paradox in electron interferometry      ,no
